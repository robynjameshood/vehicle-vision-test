## Exercises

### Exercise One (PHP)

The `LeagueTable` class tracks the score of each player in a league. After each game, the player records their score with the `recordResult` function. 

The player's rank in the league is calculated using the following logic:

- The player with the highest score is ranked first (rank 1).
- The player with the lowest score is ranked last.
- If two players are tied on score, then the player who has played the fewest games is ranked higher.
- If two players are tied on score and number of games played, then the player who was first in the list of players is ranked higher.

[ ] Implement the `playerRank` function that returns the player at the given rank.

*Don't forget it should work if the scores are changed too.*

### Exercise Two (CSS)

[ ] Make the  sidebar `<aside>` fit as expected on the right. *Hint - It just needs a tweak.*  
[ ] Make the `<footer>` be positioned at the bottom but not overlap the content when the window is smaller in height.

### Exercise Three (Forms)

[ ] Build a simple form that accepts a URL.  
[ ] Use PHP to query a URL (example below) and pass back the size of the URL in `MB`.

Example URL to query:  
https://apps.vehicle-vision.com/sales/app/files/android135/vv_sales.apk

### Exercise Four (HTML)

[ ] Fix the mistakes in the HTML.

### Exercise Five (Javascript)

Using jQuery, implement the `setup()` function that registers a click event handler and implements the following:

[ ] When the button of class `remove` is clicked, its parent `<div>` element should be removed from the gallery.

### Exercise Six (MySQL)

There are 3 mistakes in the MySQL query.

[ ] Document the 3 mistakes and what you would do to fix them

*These are general mistakes i.e. you do not need DB access to spot them.*

## Improvements

We would like to improve this test for future candidates, if you could provide us with some feedback on how you feel this test experience was for you that would be great.

**Good luck.**
